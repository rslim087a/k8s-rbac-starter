## API Calls

Here are commands that you can use to add grades to the Grade Submission API. **Windows Users should use Git Bash**.

```bash

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Harry", "subject": "Defense Against Dark Arts", "score": 95}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:31000/grades \
